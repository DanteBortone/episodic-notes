Episodic Notes
==============

A Mac OSX note taking app and personal wiki. 

**Note taking**

Take notes on:
- The word of a page of a pdf
- The cell of an excel spreadsheet
- The frame of a movie
- Files on your hard drive
- Emails
- And many other applications

Notes link back to the file, to the page and to the exact words you took notes on. File links are dynamic. Files can be renamed and moved and Episodic can still find them.

**Personal wiki**

Notes are made in topical outlines.  The names of these topical outlines become wiki words.  If these names are typed in any bullet or note they automatically create a hyperlink that will link back to that outline.


**About the repository**

This repository was made using xcode. It has two apps. The main program is "Episodic Notes". The second is a helper app "ScriptTaker‚Äù, which will listen for the keyboard shortcut.  Log out and back in for other applications to register for the shortcut  **<command @>**. Pressing this shortcut command will to make a bullet or note from other programs.

Episodic notes communicates though other applications through applescripts.  This allows users to customize the way the Episodic will handle the way to take notes for each application.
